ERROR: [Place 30-716] Sub-optimal placement for a global clock-capable IO pin-BUFGCE-MMCM pair. If this sub optimal condition
 is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .xdc file to demote this message to a
 WARNING. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to ov
erride this clock rule.

Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the pairs can be used if: (a) The global clock-capable IO (GCIO) is placed on a 
GCIO capable site (b) The BUFGCE and MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the GCIO pin. If the IOB is driving BUFGCE an
d driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below
 the IOB and the BUFGCE. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predicta
ble clock insertion delays.
WARNING: [Place 30-675] Sub-optimal placement for a global clock-capable IO pin and BUFG pair.This is normally an ERROR but t
he CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly disc
ouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The global clock-capable IO (GCIO) is placed on a GC
IO capable site (b) The BUFG is placed in the same bank of the device as the GCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met 
at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
