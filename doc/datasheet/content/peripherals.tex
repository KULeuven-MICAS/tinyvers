\chapter{Peripherals}

Most of the peripherals in \pulpissimo are connected to the \udma subsystem which
efficiently handles all the data-transfers autonoumsly.
The \udma must be programmed by the core via memory-mapped read and write operations to receive commands.

See the \udma documentation for more details under the \udma repository.

The GPIO, timers, event unit and event generator, debug and the FLLs are not connected to the \udma instead but to the APB bus.
Following a brief overview about these units is given.
