\chapter{Advanced Debug Unit}

The advanced debug unit has now a logaritmic-interconnect master interface to access peripherals and memories. In contrast to \pulpino the adv. debug unit does no longer uses AXI to communicate with the system.
All core registers are memory mapped which means that they can be read over
 the logaritmic-interconnect interface.

For more details please take a look at the documentation of the advanced debug unit.
