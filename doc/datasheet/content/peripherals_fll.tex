\section{FLL}

\pulpissimo containts 3 FLLs. One FLL is meant for generating the clock for the peripheral domain, one for the core domain (core, memories, event unit etc) and one is meant for the cluster. The latter is not used.

All the FLLs can be bypassed by writing to the JTAG register before the reset signal is asserted. See Section ~\ref{sec:soc_ctrl} for more details about the bypass register.

See the FLL documentation for more details under the FLL repository.
